### Hi, I am Pietro!
Greetings! 
I'm Pietro, a passionate junior developer. I practiced iOS technologies at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples, where I studied for two years, gaining experience in app development. 
Currently, I'm advancing my knowledge by pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the university of Naples, Federico II.
